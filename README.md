This is a Python mail sorter who find on the subject or content of a mail a regex and insert the results on a MySQL Database.

To use this, change respectives login and passwords, run the db-creator.sql file on your 
mysql server (mysql -u<USER> -p <Password> < db-creator.sql) then change the IP on the sorter.

You need install Python and Python libs.
(Next update i'll list then, I have many libs installed, I dont know who is needed to install manually)
